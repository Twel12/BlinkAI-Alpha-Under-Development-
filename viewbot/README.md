# Viewbot
### taken from github.com/Airkek/Youtube-Viewers 😆

this Feature was added in this as **viewbot is something cool, isnt it?😅**
plus the viewbot i made on python sucks, thats the reason i took it from Airkek




* i added some new PROXY URL's in the [proxy_url.txt](https://github.com/iamDyeus/KnickAI/blob/main/viewbot/proxy_url.txt) file
* you can add or remove proxy URL's in it as you wish
* i recommend you to use premium proxys 👍
